# Proposal for Predicting Virality of Space Exploration Posts Using X API and ViralBERT

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the virality of posts related to space exploration using the X API and the ViralBERT method. The goal is to identify the most important trends in the space exploration industry and optimize content strategy for a business called “Space Exploration News.”

## Business Question
As a space exploration news business organization, what are the most important trends in the industry that we should cover this week from around the world?

## Objectives
1. **Data Collection**: Use the X API to collect posts related to space exploration.
2. **Trend Analysis**: Identify trending hashtags and topics in the space exploration community.
3. **Influencer Identification**: Identify influential users in the space exploration field.
4. **Virality Prediction**: Develop a machine learning model using ViralBERT to predict the virality of posts based on content, hashtags, and user engagement metrics.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
- **X API**: Subscribe to the Basic plan to access the X API. This plan provides read access to 10,000 posts per month and access to the Trends endpoint.
- **Trending Hashtags**: Use the Trends endpoint to identify the top 50 trending topics for space exploration.
- **Sample Stream**: Utilize the 1% sampled stream to gather a broader dataset of posts related to space exploration.

### Data Preparation
- **Data Cleaning**: Clean the collected data to remove duplicates, irrelevant content, and noise.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features such as hashtags, follower counts, retweets, likes, and text sentiment.

### Model Training
- **ViralBERT**: Implement the ViralBERT model using Jupyter Notebooks. Fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model on the prepared dataset to predict the virality of posts.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Trend Analysis
- **Hashtag Analysis**: Analyze the frequency and engagement of trending hashtags to identify important trends in the space exploration industry.
- **Influencer Analysis**: Identify influential users based on their engagement metrics and content quality.

## Expected Outcomes
- **Virality Predictions**: A machine learning model that can accurately predict the virality of posts related to space exploration.
- **Trend Insights**: Insights into the most important trends and discussions in the space exploration community.
- **Influencer Identification**: A list of influential users in the space exploration field who can help amplify the reach of curated content.

## Budget
- **X API Subscription**: $100/month for the Basic plan.

## Timeline
- **Month 1**: Data collection and preparation.
- **Month 2**: Model training and evaluation.
- **Month 3**: Trend analysis and influencer identification.

## Conclusion
By leveraging the X API and the ViralBERT method, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the space exploration industry and optimize content strategy for “Space Exploration News.” The predicted virality of posts and identified trends will help the business stay ahead in the industry and engage with a broader audience.
